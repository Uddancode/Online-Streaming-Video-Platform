## ONLINE-STREAMING-VIDEO-PLATFORM
I have made a online streaming video platform just like a clone of the Youtube, Netflix or any other video streaming platforms and got to learn about the video streaming processes that how the video is being run in the server and how it is queued in the backend.

Inorder to run this project pls follow the undergoing steps :- 
1.) To start the server just run the command npm run start, inorder to install the required packages npm install dependencies 
2.) To check the video streamed in the webpage, just cd to frontend and run the command npm install to install all the packages required and then run npm run dev
